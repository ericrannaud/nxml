<html
  <body class='test'
    <section class='content'
      <p
        This is a paragraph of text. I like writing text, don't I.
        Text is nice to write.
    <section class='comments'
      <ul
        <li
          One entry in its own paragraph.
        <li| On the same line would be nice? This <b|word> is in bold.
        <li
        <li| The previous one was empty.
        <li| <span class='test'|Show as a test>.
      <p
        Go to <a href='http://google.com'|Google>.
    <p
      It is completely possible to do something nested where
      <b
        important
      stuff is isolated in the middle of the rest that way.
